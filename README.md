# Vienna

## Purpose of the project
---
The site's users are people who think about or want to visit Vienna for the first time. If the user is interested in history they can follow a link to read a very detaild overview of the history of Vienna.
This site wants to show users in a quick way, via some images, how magical the city is and share recommendations regarding sleep, eat and main sightings. They can read some information about the place and click further to go to the website of that place. The fact is that you can visit it in a very luxurious way or visit more ordinary places and still you find yourself walking around in a majestical atmoshpere. The user can decide by a click which recommendations to watch or none at all. Furthermore, the user can ask questions via the contactform. Besides that, the user can also follow the social media icons and find a great video about Vienna on youtube and more travel information about Vienna on tripadvisor if wanted/needed.
