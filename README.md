# Vienna -MS2
---
## Purpose of the project
---
The site's users are people who think about or want to visit Vienna for the first time. If the user is interested in history they can follow a link to read a very detaild overview of the history of Vienna.
This site wants to show users in a quick way, via some images, how magical the city is and share recommendations regarding sleep, eat and main sightings. They can read some information about the place and click further to go to the website of that place. The fact is that you can visit it in a very luxurious way or visit more ordinary places and still you find yourself walking around in a majestical atmoshpere. The user can decide by a click which recommendations to watch or none at all. Furthermore, the user can ask questions via the contactform. Besides that, the user can also follow the social media icons and find a great video about Vienna on youtube and more travel information about Vienna on tripadvisor if wanted/needed.

## Features
---
### Navbar
* a navbar with 3 links - to the top of the page, to the following section and to the final section - that collapses into a burger menu on mobile devices

### Vienna
* the top of the page which first shows an image, header, sub-header and some general information in a paragraph with a link to another website
### Visit
* first an image, header, sub-header and a paragraph describing some of the recommendations. Below that 3 buttons (sleep/eat/see) that change colour when clicked on and show different places on the map that are recommendations. The map on page load shows only one marker focused on the centre of Vienna. After clicking each button the related markers appear and also disappear when another button is clicked. The markers on the map are clickable which shows an infowindow to provide some quick information and a link to their website if a user wants more information. The infowindow can be clicked away. 
### Contact
* first an image, header and two lines of text, then a form. The form contains 3 fields which are all required in order to submit the form. Different popups appear when clicking on the submit button depending on if all fields are filled out or not and in case some other error occurs.

## Typography
* The Crimson Text regular 400 from Google Fonts was used for the body

1. #f8eef8 blue for body background

## Languages and technologies Used
---
* HTML - to set up the skeleton of the site
* CSS - to style the HTML elements and adjust regarding responsiveness
* JavaScript - to add interaction for a user who visits your site, like clicking on buttons that change colour when clicked and at the same time show specific places on google maps or clicking a button to submit a form which creates different popups for different situations. The user experiences more control.
* Polyfill - a shim that mimics a future API providing fallback functionality to older browsers
* jQuery - is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library which increases versatility and extensibility
* Bootstrap - provides a basic structure and offers built-in responsiveness 
* Google Fonts - to 
* FontAwesome - to use icons for a more visual appealing effect, but also functional for the illiterate
* Google maps

Features I would like to add in the future:
* EmailJS
